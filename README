Utilities to transform MARC/XML Bibliographic Records to BIBFRAME Resources.

Python and Xquery versions are provided.  Both, however, present differing
transformations of MARC/XML Bibliographic data.  They do not apply the same logic.

The Python was developed by Zepheira LLC; the XQuery version was developed by
Library of Congress Network Development and MARC Standards Office.

These transformations are under development and do not at this time propose
a canonical transformation of MARC Bib data to BIBFRAME resources.  They
are made available for evaluation and comment.
